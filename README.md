# USSD-Racharge
This project was motivated by the [Kenya USSD](#) and [Recharge King](#) where I wanted to get good of both worlds. 
This is why I went for the first prototype of this project [Kenya-USSD](https://github.com/jetsup/Kenya-USSD).
This project was archived after getting difficult to maintain and after this project was added several fetures that
adding to the [already existing project](https://github.com/jetsup/Kenya-USSD) would mean changig many parts of the 
program.

## Features
This project has:
+ USSD codes for the common service provider.
+ Ability to detect SIM Card in the respective slots and execute USSD codes on the best match line in the slot.
+ Airtime Scanning feature using [Google ML Kit](#).

## Target Features
The final app aims at incoporating:
+ Mechanism to send the various `Airtime Number` entered and the `Serial Number` of that Airtime to a **database**
 for another project under development.
+ Get `news` from the resoective **Service Provide**.
+ Keep track of the amount of credit the user has recharged using the app _(use of graphs)_.

## Note
The project focusses more on the features and does not necessarily focus on the appearance.
Also, this project was started with the intention of learning [Google ML Kit](#) along with some [Telephony Features](#) 
and therefore you might find some features that are in the app unnecessary.
